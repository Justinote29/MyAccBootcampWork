# <center>Readings

## <center>Responsive Web Design</center>
#### <a id='subRead1' href="#_readings"> (back to top)</a>
<br>

In order to get an understanding of what responsive design entails, please go through the following - RWD Intro through RWD Templates:

[CSS Responsive](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_rwd_intro.asp)

Please look through the material - no coding needed. Info only for now.

## <center>Flexbox</center>
#### <a id='subRead2' href="#_readings"> (back to top)</a>
<br>

One way to build web apps with responsive design is by using Flexbox. Please browse the following and work through tutorials as needed:

[CSS Flexbox](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_flexbox.asp)

[CSS Flex Container](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_flexbox_container.asp)

[CSS Flex Items](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_flexbox_items.asp)

[CSS Flex Responsiveness](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_flexbox_responsive.asp)

<hr>

## <center>Bootstrap</center>
#### <a id='subRead3' href="#_readings"> (back to top)</a>
<br>

With Flexbox, we use pure CSS to make our apps responsive. This may require a lot of code, classes, ids, and other resources to make sure we get a fully responsive site. 

But what if there was an easier way? And why waste our time learning Flexbox?

In order to understand what is happening `under the hood` and to be able to customize to our needs, it is imperative you have a foundation of flex - this is what Bootstrap uses to build its grid system.

Please go through the <a href='#codervox'>CoderVox</a> tutorial at this time.

And for your reference:

## <center>Being prepared for Responsiveness</center>
#### <a id='subRead4' href="#_readings"> (back to top)</a>
<br>

When working with responsive web design, there are a couple KEY concepts to remember:

1. Make sure your browser is at 100%. Do not have it zoomed in or out

1. Make sure your broswer fills the screen of your lap(desk)top as best as you can

1. DO NOT resize your browser when testing. Use the built in `Toggle Device Toolbar` that is part of your Chrome dev tools. Not sure where this is - ASK!!!

If you do not follow these three concepts, we promise - you WILL spend hours trying to figure out why your web app is not responding how you think it should when it actually is probably doing exactly what it should be.

## <center>Project #1 - Landing Page</center>
#### <a id='project1' href="#_projects"> (back to top)</a>
<br>

**Instructions:** Your task is to re-create the websites that you see from the screenshots. Each project is itâ€™s own individual website which may have one or more pages. Detailed instructions for each project are listed below. 

This is a simple, single page website built with bootstrap.

This website should have the background fill the entire screen, except for the navigation bar at the top. The nav bar has a logo on the left side, and a login/registration form on the right side.

## NOTE: use as little CSS as possible - most of this can be done with Bootstrap and through the HTML
