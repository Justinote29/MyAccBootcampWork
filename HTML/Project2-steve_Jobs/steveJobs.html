    followed by the very successful Macintosh in 1984, the first mass-produced computer with a GUI (graphical user
    interface). After being ousted of Apple in 1985, he went on to oversee the creation of two new companies: NeXT
    computer and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pixar" target="_blank">Pixar.</a> With the success of the movie
